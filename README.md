This repo demonstrates how we write and publish internal gems at
[LinkSmart](http://linksmart.com) using Jenkins to automate the release process.
It is intended as a companion to
[my blog post](http://lostincode.net/posts/building-gems-with-jenkins), so read
that for more information.

The hooks/ directory is actually not included in any our repos, as hooks are
shared between them, but it is provided here for your perusal.
